# DartPy
A python toolbox for NMR Dart data visualization

**How to use**

Here are some examples to plot the results of NMR dart measurements from Well7111. All data and figs can also be found in the example-data folder

1. Run pltT2dist_single.py to view the result of one NMR measurement

3. Run pltT2dist_ridge.py to create ridge plots of the NMR T2-dist at different depth
